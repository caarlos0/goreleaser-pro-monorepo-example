# GoReleaser Pro Split & Merge Example (real)

This repo contains a quick and to-the-point example of how to use
[GoReleaser Pro](https://goreleaser.com/pro)
[monorepo feature](https://goreleaser.com/customization/monorepo/).

The difference from this and
[the other example](https://github.com/caarlos0/goreleaser-pro-split-merge-example/commits/main),
is that this one uses the "real" OS instead of just setting `GOOS`. It also
leverages that to create Windows Docker Images.

This also serves as a [nightly](https://goreleaser.com/customization/nightlies/) example.
